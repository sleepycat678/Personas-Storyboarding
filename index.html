            <h1 class="my-3">Personas & Storyboarding: Whole Foods Self-Checkout Machines</h1>
        </div>

        <h2 class="my-4">Overview</h2>
            <p>In CSCI 1300 Personas & Storyboarding project, we need to observe real users interacting with an interface, interview these individuals about their experiences, create personas based on these users, and illustrate a storyboard for one of your personas. I chose to analyze Whole Foods self-checkout machines.</p>
            <p>The Whole Foods I went to has both self-checkout machines and traditional cashier. Self-checkout machines allow customers to scan, bag, and pay for their grocery items without a cash register employee. Notice that the self-checkout machine in Whole Foods only accepts payment by card, not cash. The main components of the self-checkout machine with which the customer interacts are shown in the sketch.</p>


        <h2 class="my-4">Sketch</h2>
            <div class="row justify-content-center text-center">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div class="card my-4">
                        <img class="sketch" src="images/self-checkout sketch.jpg" alt="Self-checkout sketch">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <ol class="my-3">
                <li>Grocery platform: the customers place their unscanned grocery on it</li>
                <li>Touch screen monitor: the customers can interact with the machine and choose payment options and some other checkout options</li>
                <li>Scanner: the customers scan items with barcode using the scanner</li>
                <li>Weighing scale: the customers can get the weight of the items without barcode such as some vegetables and fruits</li>
                <li>Bagging platform: the customers can bag the grocery items on this platform after scanning them</li>
                <li>Card reader: the customers insert/swipe their card into the card reader to complete the payment</li>
                <li>Self-checkout light: the green light indicate this machine is available and the red light indicates this machine is currently in use or needs repair</li>
            </ol>


        <h2 class="my-4">Observation</h2>
            <p>After observing the users of the Whole Foods self-checkout machine, I found that:</p>
            <ol class="my-4">
                <li>Self-checkout has shorter line (however this might be different in different areas or at different time)</li>
                <li>Users were able to go through the whole checkout process efficiently and mostly don't need help to do that</li>
                <li>Some customers pressed the wrong buttons on the screen and had to go back to the previous step</li>
                <li>One customer reached out to a Whole Foods empolyee for help and had to wait for about a minute until the problem was solved</li>
            </ol>


        <h2 class="my-4">Interview summaries</h2>
            <p>We have interviewed 8 users in 2 days, and here are some of their responses.</p>
            <ol class="my-4">
                <li>Do you prefer self-checkout or traditional cashier?</li>
                <p>5 users said they prefer self-checkout, 3 said they prefer cashier.</p>
                <li>Why do you prefer self-checkout? (asked when people said they prefer self-checkout)</li>
                <p>4 users said they think self-checkout is faster. One user said she doesn't want to interact with others.</p>
                <li>Why do you prefer a traditional cashier? (asked when people said they prefer traditional cashier)</li>
                <p>One user said that they prefer to talk to people than interact with a machine. One user said traditional cashier checkout doesn't need him to scan and bag the grocery and he prefers to use cash.</p>
                <li>How likely will you use a self-checkout machine over a traditional cashier?</li>
                <p>4 users said very like. 2 users said that depends on which line of self-checkout or cashier is shorter. 2 users said that they would only use self-checkout when the line of the cashier is too long.</p>
                <li>Do you think there are some parts of the self-checkout machine that might be confusing? If you do, which parts are confusing?</li>
                <p>4 users said that they found the instructions to be clear and the checkout process is straight forward so they didn't find anything confusing. 2 users said that the scanner sometimes doesn't work well, either it's too sensitive or too slow.</p>
                <li>If you are the designer of the self-checkout machine, how would you improve the customer experience?</li>
                <p>One user said that he would put stickers that said "scan here", "pay here" .etc on each part of the self-checkout machine to make it more clear.</p>
            </ol>
            <p>After observing and interviewing some users, I found that young people are more likely to use self-checkout and the elders might be less familiar with the self-checkout machine and would choose to use traditional cashier. People who prefer self-checkout mostly think that it's more efficient. Besides, since the self-checkout machine in Whole Foods doesn't accept cash, customers who would like to use cash will go to the cashier.</p>
            
            
        <h2 class="my-4">Empathy maps</h2>
            <h4 class="my-3">Empathy Map 1: Rushed Mary</h4>
            <p>Mary is a mother with a full-time job. She has never used a self-checkout machine before but today the cashier checkout has too many people and she wants to go back home to prepare dinner as soon as possible. So she chooses to give the self-checkout machine a try. She thought it should be easy and it turns out it is. Therefore, she is happy that it's straightforward to use and also saves her plenty of time. She would probably use self-checkout again. She represents customers that use the self-checkout machine for the first time and people who are in a rush.</p>

            <h4 class="my-3">Empathy Map 2: Introverted Mike</h4>
            <p>Mike is a student, he is an introvert and has used the self-checkout machine many times so he is super familiar with it. He likes self-checkout and if the store has a self-checkout machine, he wouldn't hesitate to choose self-checkout. He thinks self-checkout is not only time efficient but most importantly, he doesn't need to talk to anybody during the whole shopping process. Usually, he goes through the self-checkout process very quickly in order to save some time since he has lots of courses and homework. He represents some people who are used to self-checkout and people who don't want to interact with others during checkout.</p>
            <div class="row justify-content-center text-center">
                <div class="col-md-8">

                </div>
            </div>


        <h2 class="my-4">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Based on our observation and interviews, the user experience of Whole Foods self-checkout is fairly good. More and more customers are willing to use self-checkout. However, there are still issues that might cause inconvenience such as scanner sensibility problems.</p>
